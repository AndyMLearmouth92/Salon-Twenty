# Salon Twenty

Salon Twenty is a custom-designed and responsive site that I built for a North East hair salon. The salon needed a modern web presence to go with their recently renovated salon. The client asked for a sleek, modern look using their branding colours of grey and teal.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on creating a modern and professional site according to my client's specifications.

# Optimisations:
+ If I were to improve this website, I would look into adding an online booking portal rather than relying on the contact form.
+ I would also integrate with the client's social media to include photos of their work and customer reviews.

# Lessons Learned:
+ Integrating a contact form that links directly to the client's email address.
+ Working with the client to make revisions to the prototype.
+ Media queries to make the site look great across all devices.
